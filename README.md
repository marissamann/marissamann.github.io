AccountTracker

This Account Tracker Project uses Express, Node, Javascript, MongoDatabase and React technologies.
	One challenge I faced with this project was transferring information through json from the backend to the frontend.
	I struggled to provided json object responses fron Express to React until I researched status codes.
	Passing status codes as responses inside of my backend routes helped me to evaluate data through my react frontend.
I completed this whole project alone.
	My contibutions include the express backend routes getting, adding, updating and deleting records featuring specific account information.

This Banking App Project uses Express, Node, Javascript, MongoDatabase and React technologies.
	One challenge I faced with this project was tracking sessions within the express backend session.js routes
	I learned that the session variables are consistent among all web pages to carry data between different areas of the banking website.
I completed this project within a group of three.
	My contibutions include all frontend and backend aspects of the registration and login pages.
	I also implemented a lot of css, added logout functionality to all other pages, wrote almost all session logic, and completed all final touches.

This Four in a Row Game Project uses Express, Node, Javascript, MongoDatabase and React technologies.
	One challenge I faced with this project was looping through the rows and columns correctly to identify diagonal four-in-a-row wins.
	I struggled to reach the right side of the board until I diagrammed my looping process.
	I learned that psuedocode and diagrams are key to understanding logic before writing code.
I completed this project alone and all contributions are my own.
	I wrote all frontend logic to evaluate wins on the four-in-a-row board.

This Hangman game Project uses Express, Node, Javascript, MongoDatabase and React technologies.
	One challenge I faced with this project was showing the progress of the hanging man image
	I decided to use multiple images to change depending on the user's guess.
	These images revolve in the frontend using variables to track which image number comes next.
I completed this project in a group of three.
	My contributions include the hangman images and UI of the general game page.
	I also wrote the logic to track the user's guesses and maintain the status of the word being guessed.

This Tic-tac-toe game Project uses Express, Node, Javascript, MongoDatabase and React technologies.
	One challenge I faced with this project was updating the UI with the appropriate value (X/O).
	I solved this problem by tracking the turns with state variables in React.
I completed this project on my own.
	My contributions were the entire frontend visuals and the game logic.
