This Account Tracker Project uses Express, Node, Javascript, MongoDatabase and React technologies.
	One challenge I faced with this project was transferring information through json from the backend to the frontend.
	I struggled to provided json object responses fron Express to React until I researched status codes.
	Passing status codes as responses inside of my backend routes helped me to evaluate data through my react frontend.
I completed this whole project alone.
	My contibutions include the express backend routes getting, adding, updating and deleting records featuring specific account information.

This Banking App Project uses Express, Node, Javascript, MongoDatabase and React technologies.
	One challenge I faced with this project was tracking sessions within the express backend session.js routes
	I learned that the session variables are consistent among all web pages to carry data between different areas of the banking website.
I completed this project within a group of three.
	My contibutions include all frontend and backend aspects of the registration and login pages.
	I also implemented a lot of css, added logout functionality to all other pages, wrote almost all session logic, and completed all final touches.
