This Hangman game Project uses Express, Node, Javascript, MongoDatabase and React technologies.
	One challenge I faced with this project was showing the progress of the hanging man image
	I decided to use multiple images to change depending on the user's guess.
	These images revolve in the frontend using variables to track which image number comes next.
I completed this project in a group of three.
	My contributions include the hangman images and UI of the general game page.
	I also wrote the logic to track the user's guesses and maintain the status of the word being guessed.
