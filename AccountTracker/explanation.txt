This Account Tracker Project uses Express, Node, Javascript, MongoDatabase and React technologies.
	One challenge I faced with this project was transferring information through json from the backend to the frontend.
	I struggled to provided json object responses fron Express to React until I researched status codes.
	Passing status codes as responses inside of my backend routes helped me to evaluate data through my react frontend.
I completed this whole project alone.
	My contibutions include the express backend routes getting, adding, updating and deleting records featuring specific account information.
