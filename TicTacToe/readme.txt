This Tic-tac-toe game Project uses Express, Node, Javascript, MongoDatabase and React technologies.
	One challenge I faced with this project was updating the UI with the appropriate value (X/O).
	I solved this problem by tracking the turns with state variables in React.
I completed this project on my own.
	My contributions were the entire frontend visuals and the game logic.
