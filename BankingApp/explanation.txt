This Banking App Project uses Express, Node, Javascript, MongoDatabase and React technologies.
	One challenge I faced with this project was tracking sessions within the express backend session.js routes
	I learned that the session variables are consistent among all web pages to carry data between different areas of the banking website.
I completed this project within a group of three.
	My contibutions include all frontend and backend aspects of the registration and login pages.
	I also implemented a lot of css, added logout functionality to all other pages, wrote almost all session logic, and completed all final touches.
