This Four in a Row Game Project uses Express, Node, Javascript, MongoDatabase and React technologies.
	One challenge I faced with this project was looping through the rows and columns correctly to identify diagonal four-in-a-row wins.
	I struggled to reach the right side of the board until I diagrammed my looping process.
	I learned that psuedocode and diagrams are key to understanding logic before writing code.
I completed this project alone and all contributions are my own.
	I wrote all frontend logic to evaluate wins on the four-in-a-row board.
